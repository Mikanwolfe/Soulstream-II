
AI Remake

AI > Choices:

attk - choose highest skill that can finish them off, else, rest

rest - if desired skill requires energy then rest. else, if the situation is bad, then attack (with increased crit rate?)

heal - if health is low compared to starting health and if enemy can finish you off in one or two hits then:
	heal mid or max, if you can't, then rest to heal

all skills will be given a priority variable based on skillranks. 
upgrade based on priority and opponent skillranks.

"personalities" effect the priorities.

easy can be left the way it is. (based on random variables)
hard will have more intel - base game knowledge.

hard:

hard will have increased criticalrates with variable ai.criticalrate variables.

crit stats.
increased crit for users with the name "Wolfe" and maybe others. (might add a cheat file for that)
