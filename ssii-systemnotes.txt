
crl = crit limit
dfl = defence limit
pnl = penetration limit
ptl = protection limit
bll = balance limit
bml = balance multiplier limit
acl = accuracy limit
pcl = piercing limit

cr = critical rate
cm = critical multiplier
bl = balance
pc = piercing lv

hp, mp and sp (
hpa + hpx = hpl
hp/hpl
)
this is for inside battles

hp, hpa, hpx, hpl
hp = inbattle
hpa = base + added on 
hpx = for items, constantly reset
hpl = in game battle limit

st (and other stats)

st = use in calculations
sta = base + added on
stx = for items, constantly reset

oringally, a prefix of c was for classes, but in the new system, classes directly add to the a suffix.
chp = hpa + additional.

adv. lu, ew, lu are no longer class restrictions - all skills are accessible but the class-specific skills
are stronger (even cheaper?)

for skills:

acc = accuracy max			(value)
bbl = base balance			(value)
prc = piercing lv 			(value)
crr = critical rate			(percentage float100)
val = value, added mult 	(multiplier)
csc = cost, soul coins		(value)
csx = cost, experience		(value)
dil = dilation 				(multiplier)
dgm = damage min 			(value)
dgx = damage max			(value)
drm = drain min 			(value)
drx = drain max 			(value)


Starting 'Talents'
The respective stat gives 3x as much as opposed to normal.
Secondary stat gains 2x
ie Warrior gains 750 Def and +6 Piercing Lv. (etc, etc)
